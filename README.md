# esp32WS2811

Arduino Library for ESP32 to drive WS2811/WS2812 RGB leds using the RMT peripheral. The lib is lean and only drives the leds.

## Hardware

As the ESP32 uses 3.3V levels and the WS2811 uses 5V, we need a level shifting device.
I'm successfully using a TXS-0102 voltage-level translator. I've tested up to 50 leds and 
wire lengths to the first LED up to 2 meters.

Example circuit:

```
                                  3.3V                                  5V

                                                     ---
```

The pulldown resistor on OE (output enable) prevents the output
to float during startup.
Unused pins are left unconnected as they have internal 10k pullups.

## Firmware

Include the header file and define your LED string:

```C++
#include <esp32WS2811.h>

// first argument is the data pin, the second argument is the number of LEDs
WS2811 yourLedString(18, 50);
```

Start the LED string:

```C++
void setup() {
  // include your other code

  yourLedString.begin();
}
```

Change LED colours:

```C++
Colour colour = yourLedString.getPixel(size_t index);  // gives you the Colour of the led on index.
yourLedString.setPixel(size_t index, uint32_t red, uint32_t green, uint32_t blue);
yourLedString.show();  // this actually makes the LEDs light up
```

A number of helpers methods are available:

```C++
yourLedString.clearAll();  // turns off all LEDs
yourLedString.setAll(Colour colour);  // // gives all LEDs the specified colour
yourLedString.setAll(uint32_t red, uint32_t green, uint32_t blue);  // gives all LEDs the specified colour
```

Keep in mind that all these methods require to call `show()` afterwards.

## Effects

Starting and stopping an effect is done by:

```C++
void startEffect(WS2811Effect* effect);
void stopEffect();
```

You don't have to stop a running effect before starting a new one. The effect stops immediately and does not wait for it's routine to complete.
